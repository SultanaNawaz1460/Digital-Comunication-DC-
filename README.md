# Digital-Comunication-DC-
This repository contains Digital Communication lab manuals, reports, and practical implementations. It serves as a resource for understanding key concepts such as modulation, demodulation, error control, and signal transmission. With structured materials and hands-on experiments, it helps bridge the gap between theory and real-world applications.
